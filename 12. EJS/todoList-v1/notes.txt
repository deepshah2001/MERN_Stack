Templating is used to have lesser repetitive codes and when the content of different HTML pages are nearly similar.

We can do templating using various tools but we're using EJS(Embedded JavaScript Templating)

In EJS -> <%= variable_name %>

In app.js -> when render then in foo: 'FOO', foo is the key and is the variable name in ejs file while 'FOO' is the value and is from app.js file itself.

using <%.......%>, we can write javascript code in our ejs file and render it as html and works only for single line at a time.

EJS allows us to make layouts so that we can include the same code to multiple pages on our site like headers and footers.
